**FwdSh3ll** is a tiny open source framework for crafting *forward shells*. What is a forward shell? Have you ever been caught in a situation when performing a pentest you discover an RCE vulnerability in a web app but despite that you can't get a reverse shell no matter how hard you try due to strictly filtered outbound traffic? A forward shell is a scheme of shell interacting with a vulnerable Linux machine based on the **named pipes** mechanism. Check the description for details!

Showcase
==========
[![Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/200295.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/200295?autoplay=1)

This demo is showing the [HTB Stratosphere](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/129 "Hack The Box :: Stratosphere") box owning.

Description
==========
This method of getting a shell is described in a couple of IppSec's youtube write-ups ([Sokar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6ri-LFWEj4 "VulnHub - Sokar - YouTube") and [Stratosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMwcJQcUnmY "HackTheBox - Stratosphere - YouTube")). The main idea here is to create a named pipe with `mkfifo` command and `tail -f` its input to a bash process. The output would go into a regular text file which could be simply `cat`'ted. Here is how it looks like:

Dependencies
==========
### DEB Packages
  * python3.x (or newer) interpreter

### PIP Packages
FwdSh3ll makes use of the following external modules:
  * [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master "Requests: HTTP for Humans â€” Requests 2.19.1 documentation")
  * [termcolor](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor "termcolor 1.1.0 : Python Package Index")

Resolve all Python dependencies with one click via `pip`:
```
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
==========
Currently only the interactive mode is supported.
```
python3 FwdSh3ll.py [-h]

* Target URL:
    Specify the vulnerable URL to attack.

* Proxy URL (optional):
    Specify proxy if needed.

* Payload:
    Choose required payload from the list.

* Mode (single command vs forward shell):
    Choose required action.
```

Known Issues
==========
* If you get the `connection timeout` error when initializing the forward shell, just rerun the script.

Post Scriptum
